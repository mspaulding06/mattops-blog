Hello!

My name is Matt and I'm a programmer living in the Portland area.  My interests are mostly around programming languages, distributed systems, and network security -- and how to use those things to build elegant, automated, secure systems.  I blog from time to time on whatever I happen to be working on currently.  Right now my interests are in functional programming, specifically Haskell.  I've recently started the [Beaverton Haskell Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Beaverton-Haskell-Meetup) to meet with other people interested in learning the language.

When not programming I spend time with my wife and two daughters, read books, listen to podcasts, and occasionally enjoy the great outdoors here in the Pacific Northwest.
