Hello!

My name is Matt and I'm a programmer living in the Portland area.  My interests are mostly around programming languages, distributed systems, and network security -- and how to use those things to build elegant, automated, secure systems.  I blog from time to time on whatever I happen to be working on currently.  Right now my interests are in functional programming, specifically Haskell.  I've recently started the [Beaverton Haskell Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Beaverton-Haskell-Meetup) to meet with other people interested in learning the language.

When not programming I spend time with my wife and two daughters, read books, listen to podcasts, and occasionally enjoy the great outdoors here in the Pacific Northwest.

Interested in knowing more about my technical background?
