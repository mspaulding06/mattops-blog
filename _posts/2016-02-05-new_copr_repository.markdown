Decided that I would create a new Copr repository for gnome shell extensions.  Only a couple of them for now, but I'll continue to add more as time goes on.  For now there are the caffeine extension for disabling auto suspend and the screensaver, and the top icons extension for showing legacy tray icons on the top bar.
